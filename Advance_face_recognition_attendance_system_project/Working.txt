#1. Data Collection
Capture images of all people whose attendance needs to be recorded (students, employees, etc.).
Take multiple images per person to account for different angles, lighting, expressions.
Store images in a structured way (e.g., folder per person with their name as folder name).

#2. Face Encoding / Feature Extraction
Use a face recognition library (like face_recognition in Python) to detect faces in images.
Convert faces into encodings (numerical vectors representing unique facial features).
Store these encodings along with the person’s name in a database or file (CSV/pickle).

#3. Real-Time Face Detection
Use a webcam or camera feed to continuously capture frames.
Detect faces in each frame using a face detection algorithm (like HOG, SSD, or CNN-based detectors).

#4. Face Recognition
For each detected face:
Compare its encoding with the stored encodings.
If a match is found within a tolerance range, identify the person.
If no match is found, mark as “Unknown” or optionally update database for learning.

#5. Attendance Logging
Once a person is recognized:
Record their name, date, and time in an attendance log (CSV, Excel, or database).
Ensure that the same person is not logged multiple times in a short period (avoid duplicates).

#6. Optional Advanced Features
Notifications: Send email/SMS when a person is present or absent.
Mask Detection: Recognize faces even if partially covered.
Multiple Cameras: Integrate multiple feeds for large rooms.
Dashboard: Display attendance statistics in real time using GUI or web app.

#7. Deployment
Run on a PC/laptop with a webcam for small setups.
For classrooms/offices, use a dedicated camera with a Raspberry Pi or server.
Optionally integrate with existing attendance management software.
